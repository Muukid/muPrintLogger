# muPrintLogger

Public domain simple C header file that writes print calls to a log file.

# How to use

To use it, include the file `muPrintLogger.h` and use the the functions `mu_print` and `mu_printf` as if they were normal print functions, with `mu_print` only taking one string argument and `mu_printf` taking a string argument with a variable number of arguments afterwards.

In your main function, call `mupl_init()` before `mu_print` or `mu_printf` are ever called, and call `mupl_term()` right before the end of the program.

# Customization

On default, mupl creates a file called `log.txt`. The name of this file can be customized by defining the macro `MUPL_FILENAME` before including `muPrintLogger.h` to be something other than `"log.txt"`.

# Extra notes

## Slower print times

Every time something is printed, numerous calls are made, including allocation and freeing of memory, meaning that your program will run *significantly* slower per-print, especially on systems like Windows where print calls already take a considerable amount of time.

## End of log

At the end of the log generated by mupl, you should see the following message:

```
[MUPL] Program closed successfully (if you don't see this message, the program crashed!)
```

If this message does not appear, that means that `mupl_term()` was never called, which means that whether it was forgotten or the program crashed before it reached it.
